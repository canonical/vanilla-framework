## The Ubuntu typeface
We use the [Ubuntu typeface](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/) exclusively. It was recently upgraded to a variable font, which features a weight and a width axis. It now also includes true small caps. Number figures to accompany the small caps are currently being finalised and will be available soon.

## Import

```scss
@import 'vanilla-framework/scss/standalone/patterns_headings';
```
