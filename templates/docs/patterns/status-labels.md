# Status labels

<hr>

Status labels are static elements which you can apply to signify status, tags or any other information you find useful.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/status-labels/" class="js-example">
View example of the status label pattern
</a></div>

<div class="p-notification--caution">
  <p class="p-notification__content">
    <span class="p-notification__title">Deprecation warning:</span>
    <span class="p-notification__message"><code>p-label</code> and its variants are deprecated and may be removed in future version of Vanilla. Use <code>p-status-label</code> instead.</span>
  </p>
</div>

## Accessibility

### How it works

Status labels are used to signify status, tags or any other information. The colours have semantic meaning, reflected by the name given in the code example.

Semantic colour can help users recognise and recall meaning more quickly, especially when scanning a view, for example. It’s important that status labels still convey the same meaning without colour information.

### Considerations

This component strives to follow [WCAG 2.1 (level AA) guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), and care must be taken to ensure this effort is maintained when the component is implemented across other projects. This section offers advice to that effect:

- Select an appropriately coloured label which makes sense semantically for your use case.
- Ensure you don’t use colour as the only visual means of conveying information or an action - the text within the label should be descriptive enough.

### Resources

Applicable WCAG guidelines:

## Import

To import just this component into your project, copy the snippet below and include it in your main Sass file.

```scss
