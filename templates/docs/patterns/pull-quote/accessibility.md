## How it works

The pull quote component uses semantic HTML to represent a section that is quoted from another source. Containing quotes in a blockquote element means users are able to jump between quotes.

## Considerations

- If a cite element is used, it should quote the title or name of someoneâ€™s work, but not their name.
- Quotes and block quotes must only be used to highlight quotes - they should not be used to format text in italic, for example, or obtain an indented paragraph.
