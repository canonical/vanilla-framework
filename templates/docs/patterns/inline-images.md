# Inline images

<hr>

<span class="p-label--deprecated">Deprecated</span> The inline images pattern is deprecated and may be removed in future versions.<br>Please use the <a href="/docs/patterns/logo-section">logo section pattern instead</a>.

The Inline images pattern can be used to showcase a group of related images, such as a group of customer or partner logos.
