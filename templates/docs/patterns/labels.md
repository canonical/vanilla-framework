# Labels

<hr>

Labels are static elements which you can apply to signify status, tags or any other information you find useful.

<div class="p-notification--information">
  <p class="p-notification__content">
    <span class="p-notification__title">Note:</span>These labels are used to inform <a href="/docs/whats-new">status</a> of components in Vanilla.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/labels/" class="js-example">
View example of the labels pattern
</a></div>

## Import

To import just this component into your project, copy the snippet below and include it in your main Sass file.

```scss
// import Vanilla and include base mixins
// this only needs to happen once in a given project
@import 'vanilla-framework';
@include vf-base;
@include vf-p-label;
```

For more information see [Customising Vanilla](/docs/customising-vanilla/) in your projects, which includes overrides and importing instructions.
