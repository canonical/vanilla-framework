## Muted heading

<hr>

A muted heading can be used to subtly provide context to content without the heading itself being too prominent.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/headings/muted/" class="js-example">
View example of the pattern muted heading
</a></div>

### Import

To import just this component into your project, copy the snippet below and include it in your main Sass file.

```scss
@import 'patterns_muted-heading';
@include vf-p-muted-heading;
```

For more information see [Customising Vanilla](/docs/customising-vanilla/) in your projects, which includes overrides and importing instructions.
