## How it works

Modal is used to overlay an area of the screen with a prompt, dialog or interaction and prevents users from interacting with content outside of it until itâ€™s closed.

## Considerations

This component strives to follow [WCAG 2.1 (level AA) guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), and care must be taken to ensure this effort is maintained when the component is implemented across other projects. This section offers advice to that effect:

- The element that serves as the modal container should have a role of dialog and `aria-modal` set to `true`.
- The dialog has a label specified by `aria-labelledby` property that refers to a visible modal title.

JavaScript needs to be used to ensure:

- When a modal opens, focus moves to the first focusable element inside the modal.
- Focus is trapped within an open modal preventing any elements outside of the modal from receiving focus
- Tab, Shift+Tab move focus within the modal
- Escape closes the modal
- When a modal closes, focus returns to the element that triggered the modal
