{{- pattern_wip_notice() }}

The tiered list pattern is used to easily implement a list of paired titles and
descriptions underneath a top-level title and description. Optional [CTA
blocks](/docs/patterns/cta-block) can be placed at various points in the content
as well. Depending on the size and composition of your content, you can choose
from a variety of tiered list layouts:

- [50/50 on desktop with description](#5050-on-desktop-with-description)
- [50/50 on tablet without description](#5050-on-tablet-without-description)
- [50/50 on tablet with description](#5050-on-tablet-with-description)
- [50/50 with description](#5050-with-description)
- [Full-width without description](#full-width-without-description)
- [Full-width with description](#full-width-with-description)
- [With media](#with-media-new)

The tiered list pattern is composed of the following elements:

| Element               | Description                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title (**required**)  | <code>h2</code> title text                                                          |
| Description           | <code>p</code> description text with optional [CTA block](/docs/patterns/cta-block) |
| Media (optional)      | Image or video to show near description                                             |
| List item title       | Title text/content                                                                  |
| List item description | Description text/content with optional [CTA block](/docs/patterns/cta-block)        |
| Call to action block  | [CTA block](/docs/patterns/cta-block) beneath the list                              |

## 50/50 on desktop with description

This variant contains a top-level description which is presented side-by-side
with its title on desktop screen sizes.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/tiered-list/50-50-desktop-with-description/" class="js-example" data-lang="jinja">
View example of the tiered list pattern
</a></div>

## 50/50 on tablet without description

This variant does not contain a top-level description and its child list is
presented with its titles side-by-side with its descriptions on tablet screen
sizes.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/tiered-list/50-50-tablet-without-description/" class="js-example" data-lang="jinja">
View example of the tiered list pattern
</a></div>

## 50/50 on tablet with description

This variant contains a top-level description and its child list is presented
with its titles side-by-side with its descriptions on tablet screen sizes.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/tiered-list/50-50-tablet-with-description/" class="js-example" data-lang="jinja">
View example of the tiered list pattern
</a></div>

## 50/50 with description

This variant contains a top-level description. Its title and description are
presented side-by-side on desktop screen sizes, and its child list is presented
side-by-side on tablet screen sizes.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/tiered-list/50-50-with-description/" class="js-example" data-lang="jinja">
View example of the tiered list pattern
</a></div>

## Full-width without description

This variant does not contain a top-level description, and both its title and
child list are presented full-width on desktop and tablet screen sizes
respectively.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/tiered-list/full-width-without-description/" class="js-example" data-lang="jinja">
View example of the tiered list pattern
</a></div>

## Full-width with description

This variant contains a top-level description, and its title, description, and
child list are presented full-width on desktop and tablet screen sizes
respectively.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/tiered-list/full-width-with-description/" class="js-example" data-lang="jinja">
View example of the tiered list pattern
</a></div>

## With media {{ status('new') }}

You can embed an [image](#image) or a [video](#video) near the description.

### Image

You can embed a [default width](#default-width-image) or [full width](#full-width-image) image near the description.
The image may be positioned before or after the description, depending on the variant you choose.
The aspect ratio of the image depends on the variant you choose, and it will be wrapped in an [image container](/docs/patterns/images#image-container-with-aspect-ratio) to ensure it maintains the correct aspect ratio.

**Always apply the `p-image-container__image` class to your image** to ensure the image is styled correctly.

#### Default width image

This variant contains a top-level description, and its title, description, and
child list are presented full-width on desktop and tablet screen sizes
respectively. Additionally, this variant features a default width image positioned beneath the title and description.

When using the default width image, the image will use half of the page width on large screens.
We recommend following these guidelines when using the default width image:

- Use an image with a width sufficient to fill the page width on all screens.
- Use an image with an aspect ratio of approximately 16:9 to avoid using too much vertical space.
  - The Jinja macro will wrap your image in
    a [16:9 image container](/docs/patterns/images#image-container-with-aspect-ratio) and make your
    image [fill its contents](/docs/patterns/images#cover-image). Use an image with approximately a 16:9 aspect ratio,
    otherwise some of your image contents may be cropped at some screen sizes.

The following example demonstrates a good usage of the default width image variant:

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/tiered-list/50-50-tablet-with-description-with-default-width-image" class="js-example" data-lang="jinja">
View example of the tiered list pattern
</a></div>

#### Full width image

This variant contains a top-level description, and its title, description, and
child list are presented full-width on desktop and tablet screen sizes
respectively. Additionally, this variant features a full width image positioned beneath the title and description.

When using the full width image, the image will use the full width of the page on all screens.
We recommend following these guidelines when using the full width image:

- Use an image with a width sufficient to fill the page width on all screens.
- Use an image with an aspect ratio of approximately 2.4:1 to avoid using too much vertical space.
  - The Jinja macro will wrap your image in
    a [2.4:1 ("cinematic") image container](/docs/patterns/images#image-container-with-aspect-ratio) and make your
    image [fill its contents](/docs/patterns/images#cover-image). Use an image with approximately a 2.4:1 aspect
    ratio, otherwise some of your image contents may be cropped at some screen sizes.

The following example demonstrates a good usage of the full width image variant:

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/tiered-list/50-50-tablet-with-description-with-full-width-image" class="js-example" data-lang="jinja">
View example of the tiered list pattern
</a></div>

### Variable media placement

By default, the media is displayed after the description, but you can choose whether it should be displayed before or after the description.
To do this, set the `media_placement` parameter in the Jinja macro to either `before_description` or `after_description`.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/tiered-list/50-50-tablet-with-description-with-default-width-image-before-description" class="js-example" data-lang="jinja">
View example of the tiered list pattern
</a></div>

### Video

You may also use this variant to embed a video. Videos are positioned exactly the same as images, but they always have a
16:9 aspect ratio.

When embedding a video with the Jinja macro, follow the following guidelines:

- Use the `video` slot instead of the `image` slot.
- Apply the `u-embedded-media__element` class, which is provided by the [embedded media utility](/docs/utilities/embedded-media).

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/tiered-list/video/" class="js-example" data-lang="jinja">
View example of the tiered list pattern
</a></div>

## Additional CTA options

In addition to the CTA block placed below the list, you may also add CTA blocks
below the top-level description text, as well as below each list item's
description text.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/tiered-list/50-50-desktop-with-description-cta/" class="js-example" data-lang="jinja">
View example of the tiered list pattern
</a></div>

## Import

### Jinja Macro

To import the Tiered List Jinja macro, copy the following import statement into
your Jinja template:

```jinja
{% raw -%}
{% from "_macros/vf_tiered-list.jinja" import vf_tiered_list %}
{%- endraw -%}
```

View the [building with Jinja macros guide](/docs/building-vanilla#jinja-macros)
for macro installation instructions.

Since Patterns leverage many other parts of Vanilla in their composition and
content, we recommend [importing the entirety of Vanilla](/docs#install) for
full support.
