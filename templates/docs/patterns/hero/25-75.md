context:
  title: Hero | Components
  segmented_tabs:
    - title: Medium/Large
      id: medium-large
      selected: true
      example:
        path: /docs/examples/patterns/hero/hero-signpost
        before_example_content: |
          <p>
            A hero signpost with a 25-75% split that is maintained on medium-sized screens.
          </p>
          <p>
            By default, the 25/75 split is preserved on medium screens by using 2 and 4 of the available columns (turning it into 33/66% split).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is fine as long as the content of first column is small enough to fit in 2 of the gridâ€™s 6 columns, as in the following example
          </p>
    - title: Nested grid
      id: nested-grid
      selected: false
      example:
        path: /docs/examples/patterns/hero/hero-nested-grid
        before_example_content: |
          <p>
              A hero signpost with a 25-75% split that stacks on medium and small screens.
          </p>
          <p>
              In a case where content in the first column is too large to fit in 2 columns, or the content of second column being long enough to justify using full width of the screen, the layout should be adjusted to stack on medium screens (by using <code>row--25-75-on-large</code> variant)
          </p>

We encourage examining the content and finding a layout that makes better use of the available space. It is also important to pay attention to the layout in subsequent sections, and ensure the overall sequence of layouts is well balanced.
