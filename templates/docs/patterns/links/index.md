Links are used to embed actions or pathways to more information, allowing users to click their way from page to page.

## Default

Default links are a color defined by `$color-link` and are 10% darker when already visited.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/base/links/" class="js-example">
View example of the default link pattern
</a></div>

## Soft

The `.p-link--soft` class should be used on hyperlinks where many links are grouped together, such as a link cloud.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/links/links-soft/" class="js-example">

</a></div>

## Dark

The `.on-dark` class should be added on links that are placed on a dark background.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/links/links-dark/" class="js-example">
View example of the dark link pattern
</a></div>

## Inverted

The `.p-link--inverted` class should be used where links are placed on a dark background.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/links/links-inverted/" class="js-example">
View example of the inverted link pattern
</a></div>

## Back to top

The `.p-top` link can be used to make it easier to go back to the top on long pages. If the page is divided into different sections, you can use more than one per page.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/links/links-back-to-top/" class="js-example">
View example of the back to top pattern
</a></div>

## Skip link

The `.p-link--skip` link is used to help keyboard users navigate quickly to the main content of a page. It should be the first element that can be tabbed to on any page, and should reference either the `<main>` landmark region element, or the ID of an element that contains the main content of the page.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/links/links-skip/" class="js-example">

## Import

To import just this component into your project, copy the snippet below and include it in your main Sass file.

```scss
// import Vanilla and include base mixins
// this only needs to happen once in a given project
@import 'vanilla-framework';
@include vf-base;

@include vf-p-links;
```

For more information see [Customising Vanilla](/docs/customising-vanilla/) in your projects, which includes overrides and importing instructions.

## React

You can use links in React by installing our react-component library and importing `Link` component.

[See the documentation for our React `Link` component](https://canonical.github.io/react-components/?path=/docs/link--default-story#link)
