# Highlight bar

Use the highlight bar to add a horizontal separation between two sections.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/highlight-bar" class="js-example">
View example of highlight bar
</a></div>

## Import

To add a highlight bar into your project, copy the snippet below and include it in your main Sass file.

```scss
// import Vanilla and include base mixins
// this only needs to happen once in a given project
@import 'vanilla-framework';
@include vf-base;

@include vf-p-highlight-bar;
```

For more information see [Customising Vanilla](/docs/customising-vanilla/) in your projects, which includes overrides and importing instructions.
