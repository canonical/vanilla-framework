A badge is a visual indicator only for numeric values. It is static and not interactive. There are two variants:

- Undefined large number: When the amount of items is only relevant for small values, this variant should be used. When the value grows further than 999, the badge should show "999+".
- Rounded large number: When the value of the badge represents a type of information where differences between large amounts of items are relevant, it should include a decimal unit prefix and round the value. Since there is a limit of 4 characters, there are two rules regarding the prefix and the decimals:
  - Prefixes: always the largest possible decimal prefix.
  - Decimals: the rounding should only show one decimal number when the prefixed, simplified value has just one character, i.e. more than 1k but less than 10k; more than 1M but less than 10M.

## Colour coding

Badges come in 2 colours. The default is black. Use any of the flavours to style badges that have semantic or otherwise colour-coded meaning:
