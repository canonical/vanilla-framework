## Accessibility

When using the `p-contextual-menu__toggle` class on a `button` element, please ensure that the button label contains a trailing ellipsis `â€¦`, e.g. "Take action&hellip;". This is a convention used to indicate that the button launches a dialog.

In cases where a contextual menu is shown on click, focus should be set within the menu element, using JavaScript.
