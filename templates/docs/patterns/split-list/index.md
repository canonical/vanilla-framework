  title: Split list | Patterns
---

The split list pattern is used to easily implement a list of paired titles and
descriptions, complete with a top-level title and description. An optional CTA
block is placed at the bottom of the content as well. Depending on the size and
composition of your content, you can choose from a variety of split list
layouts.

## 50/50 on desktop w/ description

This variant contains a top-level description which is presented side-by-side
with its title on desktop screen sizes.
