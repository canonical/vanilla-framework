## Breadcrumbs

<span class="p-label--updated">Updated</span>

<hr>

You can use the breadcrumbs pattern to indicate where the current page sits in the site's navigation.

- A nav element with an `aria-label` "Breadcrumb" identifies the structure as a breadcrumb trail
- The set of links is structured using an ordered list
- The separators between each item are added via CSS, so you don't have to include them manually.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/patterns/breadcrumbs/" class="js-example">
View example of the breadcrumbs pattern
</a></div>

### Deprecated markup

The breadcrumb markup has been updated for accessibility reasons. Support for the <a href="/docs/examples/patterns/breadcrumbs-deprecated/">old markup</a> may be removed in future versions.

### Import

To import just this component into your project, copy the snippet below and include it in your main Sass file.
