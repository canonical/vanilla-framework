  title: Contribute a design idea or proposal
---

**Our Design System grows and improves because of people like you. Here we will walk you through our process and explain how you can contribute a design idea or proposal.**

When using our Design System, you might not find every solution you need. Before submitting a new idea:

<!-- To do: add link to documentation in Figma whenever available -->
* Review any existing documentation for the pattern or component 
* Check if your proposal was already addressed by checking the [backlog](https://github.com/canonical/vanilla-framework/issues)

If you still can’t find it, use this process to submit a contribution. You can:

* [Share an idea](/docs/contribute/idea) if you think something is missing and want to check with us before spending the time designing.  
* Once your idea is validated, we invite you to [submit a fully fledged design proposal](/docs/contribute/design-proposal). This should include more information –- for example, research, wireframes, and documentation. Once your proposal is approved, it will be added to the Design System.

Our contribution process is targeted to anyone that wants to contribute with their design or developer skills  –- from experienced professionals to students. This guide walks you through the process and explains in detail what is expected from you at every stage.

Our Design System is maintained by the Canonical Design System Team. This is the group of user experience (UX) and visual designers at Canonical that monitors this process. We review and validate ideas, approve proposals, and help you along the way.
