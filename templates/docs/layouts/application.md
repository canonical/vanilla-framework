## Application layout

<hr>

### Structure

The application layout is a full-screen grid (represented by a root element with `l-application` class) consisting of several areas (represented by elements with class names such as `l-navigation`, `l-main`, etc.). The application layout styling defines withe positioning and size of all the areas on different screen sizes (for example navigation sidebar will be fully expanded on large screens, but collapsible on small screens).

The minimal application layout should consist of the root element (`l-application`) and a navigation area (`l-navigation-bar`, `l-navigation`) with a main content area (`l-main`). The other areas (`l-aside` and `l-status`) are optional and may be added to provide additional information as required by given application use case.

#### Root element

The root of application layout (usually it will be a direct child of the document `body`) is an element with `l-application` class. This element defines the layout grid, all areas of the application layout need to be direct children of it.

#### Navigation

To provide the full responsive behaviour for small mobile screens and large desktop screens navigation in application layout consists of two areas.

Element with `l-navigation-bar` class name represents a navigation bar on top of a mobile screen that is used to toggle the navigation sidebar drawer.

Element with `l-navigation` represents the navigation sidebar. Its direct child needs to be a `l-navigation__drawer` element which represents the responsive collapsible side navigation drawer which has different behaviours on various screen sizes.

On a mobile screen the `l-navigation-bar` is visible on top of the screen and side navigation drawer renders as an overlay from the left side of the screen. The drawer can be fully collapsed by adding `is-collapsed` class to the `l-navigation` element, which should be done by a button or a link in the `l-navigation-bar`.

On medium or large screen sizes `l-navigation-bar` is not needed and is hidden, because side navigation is always visible on the left side of the screen.

On medium screens the side navigation drawer will be collapsed to a width of `3rem` and expand and an overlay of hover. Users should also be given an option to pin the side navigation, which can be achieved by adding `is-pinned` class to the `l-navigation` element.

On large screen sizes the side navigation drawer will be always expanded and the `is-pinned` or `is-collapsed` classes will have no effect on it.

#### Main content area

The main content area is an element with `l-main` class. On any screen size it's going to take all available space not occupied by other areas of the application layout.

#### Aside area

The aside area is used to display additional content, usually triggered from within main content area. It is an element with `l-aside` class. By default it is rendered as an overlay on top of main content, aligned to the right side, stretched from top to bottom of the main content area. The width of the aside content area is flexible and determined by the width of its contents.

Aside content area can be detached from right, top or bottom by adding a respective margin to it with JavaScript.

It can also be pinned, similarly to the side navigation area, by adding `is-pinned` class to the `l-aside` element. Pinned aside area is rendered to the right of the main content and makes the main content area narrower.

#### Status area

The status area is positioned on the bottom of the screen and stretches over full width of main and aside areas. It's meant to contain status bar or similar short always-available information. Its height is defined by its contents.

### Example structure

Below you can see an example of the full application layout structure with all the areas included.

### Panels

<span class="p-label--in-progress">In progress</span>

<div class="p-notification--caution">
  <p class="p-notification__response">
    <span class="p-notification__status">In progress:</span>Current implementation of panel component is created to provide minimal consistent styling of panels, but is still work in progress and may change in future when Vanilla framework fully supports application layout components.
  </p>
</div>

As the layout areas provide only minimal styling (for example drop shadows on overlay areas) the contents of the areas need to provide any spacing, backgrounds and internal layout for the panels.

To achieve consistent styling and positioning of all the application panels use the panel component (`p-panel`). It should be used as the only direct child of respective layout area (`l-navigation`, `l-main`, `l-aside`, ...). It consists of a header (`p-panel__header`) that may contain panel title, logo or any action buttons and the content of the panel in `p-panel__content`. Panel header can be optionally made sticky while scrolling with `p-panel__header--sticky`.

### Panels example

Below you can see an example of application layout with some basic panels applied.

<div class="p-notification--caution">
  <p class="p-notification__response">
    The contents of the panels (most notably the navigation side bar) are custom built for the sake of the demo and are currently not part of Vanilla framework.
