# Sticky footer

<hr>

To implement a footer that sticks to the bottom of the viewport even when there is little content on the page use the `l-site` element (that should be a wrapper around whole contents of the page and direct child of the `<body>` element) with `l-footer--sticky` inside it.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/layouts/sticky-footer/" class="js-example" data-height="400">
