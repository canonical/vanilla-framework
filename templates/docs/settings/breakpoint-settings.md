Vanilla uses three main breakpoints for screen sizes, below you can see the setting, default width and device examples at which the content will scale.

| Setting                            | Default value       | Device example    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| `$breakpoint-x-small`              | `460px`             | Mobile (portrait) |
| `$breakpoint-small`                | `620px`             | Mobile or tablet  |
| `$breakpoint-large`                | `1036px`            | Desktop           |
| `$breakpoint-x-large`              | `1681px`            | Large desktop     |

## Modifying the navigation breakpoint threshold

The `$breakpoint-navigation-threshold` is the breakpoint in which the navigation switches from horizontal (desktop devices) navigation to a burger style menu (mobile devices).

If you have a large number of menu items, you may consider overriding this value to a larger value so the navigation snaps to a burger menu at a larger breakpoint.

## Modifying the heading breakpoint threshold

`$breakpoint-heading-threshold` is the breakpoint in which the heading sizes switch from a 1:2 modular scale ratio (desktop devices) to a 2:3 ratio (mobile devices).
