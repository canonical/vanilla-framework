  title: Table cell padding overlap | Utilities

Vanilla applies padding-top and padding bottom to table cells. This is done to prevent row borders from getting too close to text that is not wrapped in a `<p>` or other text element.

In some cases it can be helpful to override this behaviour for specific children of the table cell, e.g. a `button`:

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="/docs/examples/utilities/table-cell-padding-overlap/" class="js-example">
View example of the table padding overlap
</a></div>
