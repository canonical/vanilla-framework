# Justify Content

<hr>

## Content

When you need to align contents within a container, you can use the `u-justify` utilities to force them to align center, left,right, space-between ,space-evenly,space-around or strecth.

<div class="embedded-example"><a href="../../docs/examples/utilities/justify.html" class="js-example">
View example of the content justify utility
</a></div>


## Import

To import just this utility into your project, copy the snippet below and include it in your main Sass file.

```scss
// import Vanilla and include base mixins
// this only needs to happen once in a given project
@import 'vanilla-framework';

@include vf-u-justify;
```

For more information see [Customising Vanilla](/docs/customising-vanilla/) in your projects, which includes overrides and importing instructions.
