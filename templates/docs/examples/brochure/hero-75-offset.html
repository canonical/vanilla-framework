                    <p>Multi-cloud (also referred to as multi cloud or multicloud) is a concept that refers to using multiple clouds from more than one cloud service provider at the same time. The term is also used to refer to the simultaneous running of bare metal, virtualised and containerised workloads.</p>
                    <p>In conjunction with a hybrid cloud architecture, the multi-cloud approach enables organisations to optimise their infrastructure costs. Multi-cloud reflects the reality of most organisations today and is expected to become the standard for cloud infrastructure in the coming years.</p>
