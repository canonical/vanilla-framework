      <h2>The node lifecycle</h2>
      <p>Each machine (“node”) managed by MAAS goes through a lifecycle — from its enlistment or onboarding to MAAS, through commissioning when we inventory and can setup firmware or other hardware-specific elements, then allocation to a user and deployment, and finally they are released back to the pool or retired altogether.</p>
