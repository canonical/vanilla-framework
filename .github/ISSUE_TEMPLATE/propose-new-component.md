A component in Vanilla needs to be flexible enough that it can be used across a wide range of scenarios and shouldn't be constrained to a specific number of applications.

## Visual

Provide a screenshot or link to a prototype of your pattern proposal.

## Context

Where and when might this proposed pattern be used?

## State

Does this pattern have state? If so, what are the different states (e.g. accordion with closed/open states)?

## Progressive enhancement

A pattern should be designed small screen first. How does this pattern scale up?
How will this pattern degrade on less competent browsers?
