## Slider

<hr>

You can apply the slider component on `input type="range"` elements.

### Default

The `p-slider` component allows a user to select from a specified range of values, where the precise value is not considered important.

<a href="/examples/patterns/slider/slider/"
    class="js-example">
View example of the slider pattern
</a>

### Input

The `p-slider__wrapper` and `p-slider__input` classes should be used when you want to provide a numeric representation of the slider value, as well as allow the user to specify a value.

<a href="/examples/patterns/slider/slider-input/"
    class="js-example">
View example of the slider pattern
</a>

### Import
