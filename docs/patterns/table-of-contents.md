### Import

To import just this component into your project, copy the snippet below and include it in your main Sass file.

```scss
@import 'patterns_table-of-contents';
@include vf-p-table-of-contents;

// list component is used within table of contents, so you need to include it as well
@import 'patterns_lists';
@include vf-p-lists;
```

For more information see [Customising Vanilla](/customising-vanilla/) in your projects, which includes overrides and importing instructions.

### Design

For more information [view the table of contents design spec](https://github.com/ubuntudesign/vanilla-design/tree/master/Table%20of%20contents), which includes the specification in markdown format and a PNG image.
