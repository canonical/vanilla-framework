## Grid

Vanilla has a responsive grid with the following columns and gutters:

| Screen size (px)                       | Columns | Grid gap (gutters) | Outer margins |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| 0 - $breakpoint-small                  | 4       | 1.5rem             | 1.0rem        |
| $breakpoint-small - $breakpoint-medium | 6       | 2.0rem             | 1.5rem        |
| above $breakpoint-medium               | 12      | 2.5rem             | 1.5rem        |

- The page structure must be laid out using rows (`.row`)
- All content must be within columns (`.col-*`)
- Only columns should be direct children of a row

Layouts can be created combining rows with different number of columns to an ideal maximum of 4 columns per row. Each column containing text should span a minimum of 3 columns.

### Nested columns

Columns can be nested infinitely by adding `.row` classes within columns. When nesting, remember to:
• keep track of the context (available columns), which is equal to the number of columns spanned by the parent element.
• Ensure `.col-*` classes are direct descendants of `.row` classes. Failing to do so will result in a broken layout.

### Empty columns

To leave gap columns, use col-start-{breakpoint}{index}, e.g.: col-start-large-2.
{breakpoint} - "small", "medium", "large".
{index} - an integer between 1 and the available columns.

Please note, specifying a value that exceeds the available number of columns will result in incorect offsets. This happens because the grid implicitly creates additional columns to accomodate the grid-column-start property. You should always keep track of how many available columns you have, especially when nesting. In the example below, we are indicating we want a div to span 3 columns, and start at position 7. This requires 10 total columns inside a div spanning only 4.
