## Cards

<hr>

There are four card styles available to use in Vanilla: default, header, highlighted and overlay. Our card component will expand to fill the full width of its parent container.

### Default

The purpose of the default card is to display information, without user interaction.

<a href="/examples/patterns/card/default/"
    class="js-example">

</a>

### Header

The purpose of the header card is to display information, grouped under a heading.

<a href="/examples/patterns/card/header/"
    class="js-example">
View example of the header card pattern
</a>

### Highlighted

The purpose of the highlighted card should be used when you can interact with the content.

<a href="/examples/patterns/card/highlighted/"
    class="js-example">
View example of the highlighted card pattern
</a>

### Overlay

The purpose of the overlay card is to make the text visible in conjunction with a strip image.

<a href="/examples/patterns/card/overlay/"
  class="js-example">
View example of the patterns card overlay
</a>
