## Breadcrumbs

<hr>

You can use the breadcrumbs pattern to indicate where the current page sits in
the site's navigation. The separators between each item are added via CSS, so
you don't have to include them manually.

<a href="/examples/patterns/breadcrumbs/"
    class="js-example">
View example of the breadcrumbs pattern
</a>
