## Media object

<hr>

A media object should be used to display events or articles.

  class="js-example">

</a>

### Circular

You can add an `is-round` state to the `.p-media-object__image` element to create a circular image style, which we recommend to be used for head shots of people. In order for this variant to work, the original image must be square.

### Large

Use a large variant of the component to display details of a single object on a page.

</a>

### Design
