## List tree

<hr>

The list tree pattern can be used to show a directory style listing, such as a list of files and folders within a directory.

Each directory can be opened or collapse using `aria-hidden`, set `true` for open and `false` to close on the nested list. Using JS this can be changed and should also update the `aria-expanded` attribute on the folder element.
