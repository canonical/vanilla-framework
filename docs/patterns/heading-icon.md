## Heading icon

<hr>

A header can be emphasised by adding an icon alongside the text.

### Stacked

This variant positions the icon vertically with the text content for an alternate layout.

</a>

### Small

The icon for this component is also available at a smaller size of 32 x 32 pixels rather than our default size of 60 x 60 pixels.
