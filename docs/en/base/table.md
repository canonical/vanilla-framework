## Table

The default Vanilla table adds some padding to the table cells and horizontal
dividers between each row of the table.

We recommend that you align the text in table columns that contain only digits
to the right by adding the class ```.u-align--right``` to each individual cell,
as in the example that follows. This is considered good practice when formatting
 data tables as it makes it easier to scan and compare the values quickly.
