## Code

<hr>

Vanilla gives you multiple ways to display code using the standard HTML elements.

### Inline

When you refer to code inline with other text, use the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag.

### Block

If you want to refer to a larger piece of code, use <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> together with the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag.

</a>

### Copyable

Code copyable should be used when presenting the user with a small snippet of code that they will likely want to copy and paste.

### Numbered

The code numbered pattern can be used when displaying large blocks of code to enable users to quickly reference a specific line.
