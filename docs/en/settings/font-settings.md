## Font

Vanilla uses the Ubuntu font family by default, but you can specify any other font family to better suit your project.

All Ubuntu sites and applications should use the Ubuntu font, as it has been specially created to complement the Ubuntu tone of voice. It has a contemporary style and contains characteristics unique to the Ubuntu brand that convey a precise, reliable and free attitude.
