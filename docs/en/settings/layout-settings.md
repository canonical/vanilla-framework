## Layout

These settings are used specifically to configure the grid which will determine your overall site layout. Patterns placed within the grid structure will then adapt to fill the space available to them.

Setting  | Default value
 ------------- | -------------
`$grid-gutter-width`   | `20px`
`$grid-columns`   | `12`
`$grid-max-width`   | `1030px`
