## Table mobile card

Applying the class `.p-table--mobile-card` will give any table a new responsive card view when on smaller screens. Each cell will require
an `[aria-label]` to describe the cell on a mobile screen. We use the content to create a pseudo element and keep it line with the content.

The `<thead>` element is completely hidden from  view on a smaller screen and if the table holds a `.p-contextual-menu` pattern all the children elements will be visible and be interactive.
