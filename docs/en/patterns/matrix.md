## Matrix

<hr>

The matrix component can be useful to display a selection of items in a format that is less linear than a normal list, using an image to describe each item.

Items will display in one column on small screens. At resolutions above `$breakpoint-medium`, items will display three per row.

<div class="p-notification--information">
  <p class="p-notification__response">
    <span class="p-notification__status">Note:</span>To display correctly on large screens, you'll need to add list items in a multiple of three. If you do not have content for all the items, leave them empty but the list item must be present.
  </p>
</div>
