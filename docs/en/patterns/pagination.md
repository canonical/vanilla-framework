## Pagination

<hr>

The pagination component should be used to navigate between pages of content. Depending on the length provided, the pagination component will automatically scale.

### Truncated

When it is not possible to fit all pages into the component, a truncated option should be used to give the first, last and as many siblings of the current page as possible.

### Disabled controls

When a user is at the first or last item then the previous or next button, respectively, should be disabled.
