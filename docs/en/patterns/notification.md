## Notification

### .p-notification

Notifications are used to display global information. A notification will display at the top and fill the full width of the page. A notification can be a default, caution, negative or position. You can also include a close button using the `p-icon--close` pattern, although you will need to implement the click function yourself.

### .p-notification--caution

### Adding actions

Notifications have the ability to add an action link to them. These should appear inline with the notification response and will add margin between the link and content.

Note: All functionality must be developed in independently.
