## Accordion

Side bar accordion, used in listing pages or as navigation. Can hold multiple navigation items or to be used as a filter of content.
Use to hold filtering items (header and content if available). Do not use to display page content.

Each tab styling can be changed to open or collapse using `aria-expanded`, set `true` for open and `false` to close. Using JS this can be changed and to point to what each tab controls via `aria-controls`.

`.p-accordion__panel` visibility is effected by `aria-hidden` and again can be manipulated with JS.
