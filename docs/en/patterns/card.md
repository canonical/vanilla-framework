## Card

There are two card styles available to use in Vanilla.

A card will expand to fill the full width of its parent container.

All card styles, but in particular the highlighted card, should be used sparingly.

### Basic card

The purpose of the basic card is to display information, without user interaction.

### Highlighted card

The highlighted card should be used when you can interact with the content.

### Overlay card

The purpose of the card overlay pattern is to make the text visible in
conjunction with a strip image.

### Optional header

Both cards have styles for an optional header.

The header will accept either text or an image with a max height of 32 pixels and has a border below.
