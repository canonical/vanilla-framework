## Animations

<hr>

Vanilla provides a choice of duration and easing for animating components.

### Duration

Recommended durations for animations are stored in the map `$animation-duration`.

Components that animate statically, like a button that changes background
color, tend to have a shorter duration than components with motion
animation.

| Setting  | Default value |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `snap`   | `.1s`         |
| `fast`   | `.165s`       |
| `brisk`  | `.333s`       |
| `slow`   | `.5s`         |
| `sleepy` | `1s`          |

<hr>

### Easing

Recommended durations for easing can be `easeInCubic` or `easeOutCubic`.

| Setting | Default value                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `out`   | `cubic-bezier(.215, .61, .355, 1)`   |
| `in`    | `cubic-bezier(.55, .055, .675, .19)` |

### Spin

Add a spin animation to an element with the following utility class.

<a href="/examples/utilities/animations/spin/" class="js-example">

</a>

### Reduced motion

Vanilla implements the [prefers-reduced-motion CSS media feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) so that - in supported browsers and operating systems - users with an accessibility need or preference see reduced animation applied to page elements.

Currently, Vanilla's implementation of this feature is a simple media query where both animations and transitions are set to `none !important` for all HTML elements. Nothing needs to be done to use this feature in your pages but we encourage using animations and transitions in a progressive manner so that your web sites and applications are usable without animations being present.

### Usage

Animations are preset to components. Components can be modified or extended to
include animation by including the animation mixin.

The format is as follows:

```scss
@include vf-animation(PROPERTY, DURATION, EASING);
```

<div class="p-notification--information">
  <p class="p-notification__response">
    <span class="p-notification__status">Note:</span> The list of valid `DURATION` and `EASING` options are shown in the <a href="#duration">duration</a> and <a href="#easing">easing</a> sections of the documentation.
  </p>
</div>

A valid use could be, for example:

```scss
@include vf-animation(height, brisk, out);
```

If you require multiple properties then the list must be interpolated as shown in the following example:

```scss
@include vf-animation(#{height, width}, brisk, out);
```

### Design
