## Working on an issue

To work on an issue, please fork this repo and create a new branch on your local fork. When you're happy and would like to propose that changeset to be merged back upstream, open a pull request to merge from your local `origin/master` to `upstream/develop`.

When committing changes, make sure to group related changes so that the project is always in a working state. Use succinct yet descriptive commit messages to allow for easy reading of the commit log.
