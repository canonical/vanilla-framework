## Truncation

<hr>

To truncate text, use the class `u-truncate`.

When applied to a parent container, it will truncate any elements placed inside, so long as the parent's width is set.
When applied to individual elements within a parent, e.g. a table cell, only those elements will be truncated.

<a href="/examples/utilities/truncate/"
    class="js-example">
View example of the truncate utility
</a>

Note: `u-truncate` will affect any tooltips placed inside.
