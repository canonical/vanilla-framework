These do pretty much what they say on the tin.

## .u-float--right

This will float the element on which it is applied to the right of it's parent.

```html
<div class="u-float--right">
    Content floated right
</div>
```

<div class="pl__demo clearfix">
    <div class="u-float--right">Content floated right</div>
</div>


## .u-float--left

This will float the element on which it is applied to the left of it's parent.

```html
<div class="u-float--left">
    Content floated left
</div>
```

<div class="pl__demo clearfix">
    <div class="u-float--left">Content floated left</div>
</div>
