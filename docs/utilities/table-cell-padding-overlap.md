## Table cell padding overlap

<hr>

Vanilla applies padding-top and padding bottom to table cells. This is done to prevent row borders from getting too close to text that is not wrapped in a `<p>` or other text element.

In some cases it can be helpful to override this behaviour for specific children of the table cell, e.g. a `button`:

</a>
