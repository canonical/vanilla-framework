## .u-off-screen

This class will position an element out of the page flow and off-screen. It will however still be available to screen reader users.

```html
<div class="u-off-screen">
    To hear a hilarious joke, navigate this page with your favorite screen reader. ;)
</div>
```

<div class="u-off-screen">
    Two CSS properties walk into a bar. A barstool in a completely different bar falls over. Geddit?!
</div>
