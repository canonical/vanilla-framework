### Releasing on GitHub

- Publish the latest release on [Github](https://github.com/canonical-web-and-design/vanilla-framework/releases/) with the new version number and add the release notes you created earlier.
  - Make sure to mark the release as a pre-release if it's an Alpha or Beta

### Releasng to NPM

This should happen automatically after publishing the release on GH (thanks to [GH actions workflow](https://github.com/canonical-web-and-design/vanilla-framework/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish-on-release.yml)).

In case that fails, here are manual steps to release to NPM:

- Update your local tags with `git fetch --tags`
- Check out the tag with `git checkout TAGNAME`
- Publish the package with `npm publish` and check that your new release appears on the [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vanilla-framework)

In case that fails, here are manual steps to release to assets server:

- `./run build`
- `upload-assets --url-path vanilla-framework-version-X.X.X.min.css build/css/build.css`

## Releasing React Components
