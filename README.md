[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ubuntudesign/vanilla-framework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ubuntudesign/vanilla-framework) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/vanilla-framework.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/vanilla-framework)

Vanilla is a guidelines framework to help you achieve a consistent look, bringing the [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and [Canonical](http://www.canonical.com/) brands to the web with precision. Here you will find the Ubuntu web style guide and a front-end framework, which you can apply to your web projects maintained by the [Canonical Web Team](https://github.com/orgs/ubuntudesign/people).

Sites created within Canonical should follow this style guide closely, whereas external sites are free to adapt and expand the existing components to their needs.

To get started and see examples go to our [design](http://design.ubuntu.com) site.
